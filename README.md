# 🎭 Emotion-Aware NPC System

This project demonstrates **how AI-powered NPCs can detect human emotions in real time using a webcam feed and respond using speech and generates NPC (Non-Player Character) dialogue responses based on the detected mood.**. It showcases how emotional intelligence can be integrated into virtual agents — an essential innovation for metaverse avatars, gaming, and human-AI interaction systems.

# 🔮 Future Improvements

- Animated 2D/3D avatars
- Multifacial detection
- VR/metaverse integration
- Emotion memory tracking

---

# 🎯 Outcome

✔️ Successful demonstration of AI-driven emotional interaction
✔️ Fully working prototype
✔️ Valid implementation under “AI-Driven Innovation in the Metaverse”

---

# 📊 Results & Conclusion

- The system successfully detects user facial emotions in real-time using the webcam.
- NPC responses are emotion-aligned and spoken clearly via voice output, enhancing user interaction.
- The bounding box and emotion label display help visually confirm detection.
- Response timing is managed using a cooldown mechanism, which prevents over-sensitivity or rapid speech.
- Works smoothly for front-facing users under normal lighting conditions, showing practical performance.
- The project effectively demonstrates how AI-driven emotional intelligence can be integrated into virtual NPCs to provide a more natural and immersive interaction.

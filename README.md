# 🎭 Emotion-Aware NPC System

This project demonstrates **how AI-powered NPCs can detect human emotions in real time using a webcam feed and respond using speech**. It showcases how emotional intelligence can be integrated into virtual agents — an essential innovation for metaverse avatars, gaming, and human-AI interaction systems.

| Feature                              | Status | Description                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Real-time webcam input**           | ✅      | Captures video of the user.                           |
| **Emotion detection (FER + OpenCV)** | ✅      | Detects happy, sad, angry, neutral, fear, surprise.   |
| **NPC response system**              | ✅      | NPC replies emotionally based on detected expression. |
| **Voice output (macOS say)**         | ✅      | NPC speaks responses.                                 |
| **Basic UI (bounding box)**          | ✅      | Displays face detection & emotion label.              |

# 📊 Results & Conclusion

- The system successfully detects user facial emotions in real-time using the webcam.
- NPC responses are emotion-aligned and spoken clearly via voice output, enhancing user interaction.
- The bounding box and emotion label display help visually confirm detection.
- Response timing is managed using a cooldown mechanism, which prevents over-sensitivity or rapid speech.
- Works smoothly for front-facing users under normal lighting conditions, showing practical performance.
- The project effectively demonstrates how AI-driven emotional intelligence can be integrated into virtual NPCs to provide a more natural and immersive interaction.
